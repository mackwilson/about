  "about": "Hey! I’m Mack! I’m a software engineer from the University of Waterloo . Throughout my degree, I had five internships in various fields, roles, and cities across North America. I’m currently a software engineer on Branch Metrics’ platform engineering team. \n\nI love the fast pace, complexity, and freedom of software engineering, and I’m most interested in building reliable distributed systems and microservices in Java, JavaScript, Go, and Python, with tools such as Kubernetes and AWS. I’m also a skilled communicator, leader, and organizer, which has led me into a variety of project management positions. I have a creative side, too, enjoying everything from UI/UX design, to photography, to music. I also try to get involved in community events and inclusivity initiatives whenever I have the chance, and I play competitive rugby. \n\nScroll to learn more about me, and click each entry to epand it.
